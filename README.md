# CIS7031_Programming_for_Data_Analysis_-_-Assessment
A Pandas-based, K-Means oriented project I completed during my Master's degree course at Cardiff Metropolitan University. 

This project was created in on GitHub in June 2022, but was actually completed in 2020 for the CIS7031 module. The purpose of the project was to perform various forms of data analysis on the state of Wales' employment data gathered by the ONS (Office for National Statistics).
